# MyReads Project: A Book Lending App

This is my realization of the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.
It is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

## How to make it work

To make the application work, you should have npm installed and run the
following commands from a terminal:

* `npm install`, to install all project dependencies
* `npm start`, to start the server

Now you can reach the application from the browser at [this](http://localhost:3000/) address.
